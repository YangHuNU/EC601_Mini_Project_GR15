# What we like doing
    When we were brainstorming, there were some other ideas coming across. We researched for each idea. 

# What we could have done better
    There are some flaws for our final product. For example, we can feed any kind of keyword and provide sentiment. We did not manage to emphasize the unique use for smoking sentiment analysis.

# What we will avoid in the future
    There were times when we didn't get each other posted. One person had some progress and the other person learned a couple days later. We should've worked out a trello list or something similar.
