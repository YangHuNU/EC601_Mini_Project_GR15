# What we like doing?

    When we were discussing the main topic of our project, we looked through the hashtags of twitter and found a large number of interesting topics, which were all worth to be analyzed.
  

# What we could have done better？
    
    We use google api to pick up entities in the text and analyze the sediment of the entities but we cannot only filter the entities related to juul. The result contains some unrealted entities. We could have made the system pick up more specific entities.

# What we will avoid in the future？
    
    We should communicate more and develop a schdule to push each other finish the tasks more efficiently
