# Tweet output

## What are these output?
    Each file contains one twitter feed obtained from [API.search](https://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) by keyword. 

## What are they for?
    They are going to be sent for sentiment analysis with Google API.

***Note: these four files are just sample outputs. In fact, with our code written down, 20 tweets will be obtained; it will generate 20 ".txt" files. ***
